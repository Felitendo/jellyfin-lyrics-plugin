# MERGED INTO JELLYFIN (kind of)

This Repository got archived because Jellyfin has merged the Plugin into their official repository. Please install the "LrcLib" Plugin from the official Jellyfin Repository instead. This Plugin should have the exact same features as mine and should get updated regularly. You can find the new official repository [here](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-plugin-lrclib)

Although they haven't updated it in 8 months. Wich means i might get back to fixing some small issues when i have time
